This project includes the calculations of the standard deviaition (sigma), and the variance based off of one set of inputs. These two pieces of information tell us the dispersion of the data and measure the spread. The higher the variance is, the more spread out the data happens to be. The linear regression rwquires two sets of data ( X and Y), this calculation allows us to find the equation of a line (y = mx + b) that most accurately fits the provided data points to accurately measure any trends in the data.
